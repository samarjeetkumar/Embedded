Week 1 Application Assignment of Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments

I am Samarjeet Kumar singh. It's a first Application Assignment of Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments.
In this programming assignment you will create a simple application that performs statistical analytics on a dataset.
The stats.c and stats.h files  have some premade function comment format for you to enter data into. You will need to include your name as the author, 
the date, and a small description of the file at the top. If you open stats.c  you will see you have been given part of a main() function. 
Main has defined an array of 40 characters for testing.

I am writing eight functions in the stats.c implementation file:

main()
print_statistics() 
print_array()
find_median()
find_mean()
find_maximum() 
find_minimum()
sort_array()
